🚀 Form-Validation 🚀

This task task was all about enhancing a Registration form using JavaScript. The goal was to implement form validation, ensuring that the form input fields meet the required conditions before submission. Here’s what I’ve accomplished:

🔍 Task Overview:

Name Field: Validated to ensure it’s non-empty and contains only alphabetic characters (no numbers).

Email Field: Verified for a valid email format (Gmail only in this case).

Password Field: Checked for a minimum of 6 characters.

💡 Key Features:

Real-time Validation: Displaying error messages if the user inputs invalid data.

Success Message: If all fields are valid, a success message appears, and the form disappears.

User Experience Focused: All error messages are shown dynamically, allowing users to correct their inputs before submission.

✨ Takeaways:

Learned how to combine regular expressions (regex) with JavaScript for effective form validation.

Worked on hiding and showing elements based on validation outcomes to create a dynamic user experience.

Improved my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
